#### D3 coordinated vizualization

Created by Tom Lee, April 2019.

This visualization shows New York City housing demographic data sourced from the US Census Bureau 2017 American Community Survey at the census tract level. The visualization was created using D3. It has data for just over 2000 tracts, which makes it a little slow to run client-side.
